# Phaser 3 Project Template

A fork from the original project template made to create our own notes and standards.

## Synopsis

This repository was forked from [photonstorm](https://github.com/photonstorm)'s [phaser3-project-template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) in order to facilitate our own version of it.  This repo is intended to be well documented as to be easily understood by any.  Please feel free to subsequently fork this for your own use :).  Please see the original `README.md` file contained in the `./Documentation` directory of this repository.
